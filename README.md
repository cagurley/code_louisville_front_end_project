# **(OHLM) HOMEPAGE**

Just open index.html and poke around.

The portal/entrance illusion is accomplished with JavaScript, so the landing page might look especially wonky with JS disabled.

The contact form is functional, requiring no server side code. You can click the link in the description to automatically open your default email client to edit your message, but this won't work if you haven't specified a valid default. I also don't want to bother the band before they even know about this project, so all emails will be directed to my personal account.

Thanks for reviewing my site! Please let me know where I can most improve the site.
