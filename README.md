# **(OHLM) HOMEPAGE**

## *Viewing Project and Files*

To view, just open index.html in the browser and poke around.

This project is built on Bootstrap with JQuery and utilizes a Google font. The appropriate <link> and <script> tags can be found at the end of the head and the end of the body, respectively.

The custom CSS used is linked at the bottom of the head; to view it, navigate to 'css/custom.css'. The JavaScript snippet for YouTube's iframe API is linked at the end of the body; to view it, navigate to 'js/embed.js'. Finally, my custom JavaScript, based on a W3C script for smooth screen scroll animation and containing the code for my screen transitions and audio playback, is also linked at the end of the body; to view it, navigate to 'js/app.js'.

## *Notes on Functionality*

The portal/entrance illusion is accomplished with JavaScript, so the landing page might look especially wonky with JS disabled.

The play button .svg images function as simple play/pause audio controls for the track I have selected; please click to listen.

The contact form is functional, requiring no server side code, but you must have a default email client specified and properly set up. You can click the link in the description to edit everything in the client or click the submit button to carry the values of each field into the body of the email. I also don't want to bother the band before they even know about this project, so all emails will be directed to my personal account.

The video player included is added via YouTube's iframe API and resized with a wrapper div (the credit for which belongs entirely to Leslie and his thorough research). It is loaded with an unlisted playlist of mine.

### Thanks for reviewing my site! Please let me know where I can most improve.
